    <h2>Get Help & Support</h2>

    <p>To support our users, we provide resources and links to organizations and support systems that specialize in gambling addiction help. These services can offer professional advice, counseling, financial guidance, and emotional support. Taking the first step toward help is a sign of strength — not weakness.</p>
    <p>We strongly advise all users to set strict budgets, take regular breaks, and never treat gaming as a reliable source of income. Your health and safety will always matter more than any game.</p>
